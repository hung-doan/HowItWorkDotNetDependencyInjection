#How It Work - Dot Net Dependency Injection (HiwDI)
HiwDI is a simple project to describe how to implement Dependency Injection in .NET (C#).

It mainly focus on: 

1. [**What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?**](https://github.com/hungdoan2/HowItWorkDotNetDependencyInjection/blob/master/docs/what-is-inversion-of-control.md)
2. [**What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**](https://github.com/hungdoan2/HowItWorkDotNetDependencyInjection/blob/master/docs/what-is-dependency-injection.md)
3. [**What are the advantages and disadvantages of DI?**](https://github.com/hungdoan2/HowItWorkDotNetDependencyInjection/blob/master/docs/what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-di.md)
4. [**How to implement DI manually?**](https://github.com/hungdoan2/HowItWorkDotNetDependencyInjection/blob/master/docs/how-to-implement-di-manually.md)
5. [**How to implement DI automatically?**](https://github.com/hungdoan2/HowItWorkDotNetDependencyInjection/blob/master/docs/how-to-implement-di-automatically.md)
